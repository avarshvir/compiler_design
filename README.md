# Compiler Design
- This repository contain the various implementation phases of compiler such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, sematic analysis, intermediate code generartion and many more.

## What is Compiler?
Compiler is a program or a software that translate or convert the a program written in high level language into a low level language(assembly language, machine language,target language) that can be executed by computer processor.

## What is Compiler Design?
Compiler Design is a process of creating a compiler, which is a software that responsible for translating source code written in high level language into machine code that can be executed by computer processor.
### Compiler Design involves severals key aspects : 
- language specification
- lexical analysis
- syntax analysis
- semantics analysis
- intermediate code generation
- intermediate code optimization
- target code generation
- target code optimization
- debugging and error handling
- data structures like symbol table and literal table
