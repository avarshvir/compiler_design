Certainly! Letâ€™s break down the logic of the reduce function step by step:

Purpose of the reduce Function:
The reduce function is responsible for performing the reduction operation during operator precedence parsing.
It combines two operands (numbers) with an operator to produce a new result.
Parameters:
The function takes two parameters:
operators: A reference to a stack of characters (operators).
operands: A reference to a stack of integers (operands).
Popping the Top Operator and Operands:
char op = operators.top();: Retrieves the top operator from the operators stack.
operators.pop();: Removes the top operator from the stack.
int b = operands.top();: Retrieves the second operand (top operand) from the operands stack.
operands.pop();: Removes the second operand from the stack.
int a = operands.top();: Retrieves the first operand (new top operand) from the operands stack.
operands.pop();: Removes the first operand from the stack.
Switch Statement Based on the Operator (op):
The switch statement evaluates the value of op (the operator).
Depending on the operator, it performs the corresponding operation on operands a and b.
The result of the operation is pushed back onto the operands stack.
Operator Cases:
case '+': operands.push(a + b);: Adds a and b and pushes the result back onto the stack.
case '-': operands.push(a - b);: Subtracts b from a and pushes the result.
case '*': operands.push(a * b);: Multiplies a and b and pushes the result.
case '/': operands.push(a / b);: Divides a by b and pushes the result.
Overall Effect:
The reduce function combines the top operator with the top two operands, following the specified operation.
It effectively reduces the expression by replacing the operator and operands with the computed result.
In summary, the reduce function is a crucial part of the operator precedence parsing algorithm. It ensures that the correct arithmetic operation is applied to the operands based on the operator at the top of the stack. This process continues until the entire expression is evaluated, resulting in a final value on the operands stack
