Certainly! Letâ€™s break down the logic of the operatorPrecedenceParser function step by step:

Purpose of the operatorPrecedenceParser Function:
The operatorPrecedenceParser function evaluates an arithmetic expression based on operator precedence rules.
It takes an input expression (e.g., "3+4*2-5") and computes the result.
Parameters:
The function takes a single parameter:
expression: A string representing the arithmetic expression to be evaluated.
Stacks:
The function uses two stacks:
operators: A stack to store operator characters (+, -, *, /).
operands: A stack to store integer operands (numbers).
Processing the Expression:
The function iterates through each character c in the input expression.
If c is a digit (0-9), it converts it to an integer and pushes it onto the operands stack.
If c is an operator, it follows these steps:
While the operators stack is not empty and the precedence of c is less than or equal to the precedence of the top operator in the stack, it performs the reduce operation (explained next).
Then, it pushes the current operator c onto the operators stack.
reduce Operation:
The reduce operation combines the top operator with the top two operands from the operands stack.
It pops the operator and operands, applies the corresponding arithmetic operation, and pushes the result back onto the operands stack.
Final Reduction:
After processing all characters in the expression, the function performs a final reduction by applying any remaining operators in the operators stack.
Result:
The final result of the expression evaluation is the top value on the operands stack.
In summary, the operatorPrecedenceParser function uses stacks to handle operators and operands, following the specified precedence rules. It evaluates the expression step by step, reducing it until a single result remains on the stack. The result is then returned as the final output.
